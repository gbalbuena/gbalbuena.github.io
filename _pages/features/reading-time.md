## Where?

This could be located at the bottom of the article, on the right side or as part of the metadata panel.

There's no special information in regards to this thata I could refer, but for now, just where is not capting all the attention but could give good value information about the reading time to the interested audience.

## How To Calculate Estimated Reading Time

### Method 1: Do The Math

The average adult reads 200-250 words in one minute.

Convert words into minutes here, some decimals into seconds there, a little rounding at the end… and you can calculate estimated time to read manually.

Here’s how:

1. Find your total word count. Let’s say it’s 938 words.
2. Divide your total word count by 200. You’ll get a decimal number, in this case, 4.69.
3. The first part of your decimal number is your minute. In this case, it’s 4.
4. Take the second part — the decimal points — and multiply that by 0.60. Those are your seconds. Round up or down as necessary to get a whole second. In this case, 0.69 x 0.60 = 0.414. We’ll round that to 41 seconds.

The result? 938 words = a 4 minute, 41 second read.

But that’s really specific. Why not round that time to make things simpler for your reader? Anything less than 30 seconds gets ignored; anything more than 30 seconds gets rounded up to the next minute.

That rounding makes your 938-word article a 5-minute read.

## When You Shouldn’t Use it

Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.

Estimated reading times make no sense for these types of online content:

* Slideshows
* Infographics
* Product pages
* Landing pages
* Brief, frequent blog posts, etc (think Seth Godin-style)
