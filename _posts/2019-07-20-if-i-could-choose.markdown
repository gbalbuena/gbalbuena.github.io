If I could choose where and what to work with I will always choose

our infrastructure and my core logic declarative over imperative

our code implementation imperative and explicit over declarative

our architecture and code clean and tidy over complex and messy

our systems stupids and simple over ingenious and complicated

my team friendly and humble over strict and competitive

If I could
