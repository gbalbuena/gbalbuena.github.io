The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into the other, so the result is a positive integer, sensitive to string length . Which make it more difficult to draw pattern.

For example:
* the Levenshtein distance between “foo” and “bar” is 3
* the Levenshtein distance between “beauties” and “beautiful” is also 3
* For us, humans, the “beauties”/”beautiful” pair is much more similar than the “foo”/”bar” pair. But the Levenshtein distance is the same.
