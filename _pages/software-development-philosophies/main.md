title: Software development philosophies
---

This is a list of approaches, styles, and philosophies in software development. It also contains programming paradigms, software development methodologies, software development processes, and single practices, principles and laws.

## Large-scale programming styles</h2>

- Behavior-driven development
- Design-driven development
- Domain-driven design
- Secure by design
- Test-driven development
  * Acceptance test–driven development
  * Continuous test-driven development
  * Specification by example

<h2>Specification-related paradigms</h2>

- Iterative and incremental development
- Waterfall model
- Formal methods

<h2>Comprehensive systems</h2>

Agile software development
Lean software development
Lightweight methodology
Adaptive software development
Extreme programming
Feature-driven development
ICONIX
Kanban (development)
Cowboy coding (a non-system)

<h2>Rules of thumb</h2>

KISS principle
Minimalism (computing)
Open–closed principle
Release early, release often
Rule of least power
There's more than one way to do it
Unix philosophy
Worse is better
You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)
Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
SOLID (object-oriented design)
Single source of truth (SSOT)
Single version of the truth (SVOT)
