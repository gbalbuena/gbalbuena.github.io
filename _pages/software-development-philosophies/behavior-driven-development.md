In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.[1][2][3] It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.[4] It emerged from test-driven development (TDD).[1][2][5][6][vague][7] Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.[2][7]
