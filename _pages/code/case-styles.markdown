In simple words is how to combine works without using spaces.

Snake case (stylized as snake_case) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are separated with one underscore character (_) and no spaces, with each element's initial letter usually lowercased within the compound and the first letter either upper- or lowercaseâ€”as in `foo_bar` and `Hello_world`.
